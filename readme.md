# Wordle Analysis
Goal: Check assumptions about the nature of the wordle solutions.
Namely: 
1. It feels like some words appear as answers more frequently than others.
2. If feels like wordle words are not extremely uncommon, nor extremely common.
3. I have heard that wordle never uses plurals as solutions (few words have a trailing "s").
